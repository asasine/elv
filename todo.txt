* the wait time is global (but this is not such a big deal... because I still cache the too soon responses, so only one additional call per a riddle)
* improve the compartmentalization of responsibilities between the main, driver and the aoc api (the driver should return Result<> and everything should be silent until the main)
only main prints anything as the interface, the rest just passes values
* change all the unwraps into chain_err
* consider adding some progress bar when waiting for the aoc api
* fix tests (clear_cache fails sometimes, some race conditions regarding files, I guess)
* add a better Decorator for text2html (right now it is text2html::PlainDecoration)!
* dynamic terminal width
* list directories command
* release on homebrew
