* the wait time is global (but this is not such a big deal... because I still cache the too soon responses, so only one additional call per a riddle)
* github ci/cd
* improve the compartmentalization of responsibilities between the main, driver and the aoc api (the driver should return Result<> and everything should be silent until the main)
only main prints anything as the interface, the rest just passes values
* improve the output of the application - nice icons, logs that are friendly etc...
* output the submission answers nicely (html2text or something)
* revise error handling...
* add downloading the riddle description
